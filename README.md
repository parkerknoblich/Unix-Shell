# Unix-Shell

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process.  Your implementation will support input and output redirection, as well as pipes, as a form of IPC between a pair of commands.  Completing this project will involve using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe() system calls and can be completed on any Linux, UNIX, or macOS system.

I. Overview <br/>
A shell interface gives the user a prompt, after which the next command is entered. The example below illustrates the prompt osh> and the user's next command: cat prog.c.  (This command displays the file prog.c on the terminal using the UNIX cat command) <br/>
osh>cat prog.c <br/>
One technique for implementing a shell interface is to have the parent process first read what the user enters on the command line (in this case, “cat prog.c”) and then create a separate child process that performs the command.  Unless otherwise specified, the parent process waits for the child to exit before continuing.  This is similar in functionality to the new process creation illustrated in OSC Figure 3.9.  However, UNIX shells typically also allow the child process to run in the background.  To accomplish this, we add an ampersand (&) at the end of the command.  Thus, if we rewrite the above command as:osh>cat prog.c &the parent and child processes will run concurrently.The separate child process is created using the fork() system call, and the user's command is executed using one of the system calls in the exec() family (as described in OSC Section 3.3.1)A C program that provides the general operations of a command-line shell is supplied in OSC Figure 3.32 (shown below).  The main() function presents the prompt “osh>” and outlines the steps to be taken after input from the user has been read. The main() function continually loops as long as should_run equals 1; when the user enters exit at the prompt, your program will set should_run to 0 and terminate.
